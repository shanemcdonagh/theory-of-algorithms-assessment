# Theory of Algorithms: Assessment

## Introduction
This repository is a visual representation in which came from researching and exploring the topic of <b>Polynomial Time</b>. Within this repository, you will find the following topics being covered in relation to Polynomial Time:

- Computational Complexity
- Polynomial Time: Definition
- Complexity Classes
- Turing Machines: Deterministic and Non-Deterministic
- P versus NP

The research undertaken has been represented within a Jupyter notebook,  a <a href="https://jupyter.org/"> web-based interactive computing platform</a>, which can be found within this repo. All defining topics are readily documentated with the usage of graphs and coding examples through Python, to help communicate each concept in a useful way.

<i>All resources used to help aid with discussing these concepts have been referenced accordingly within the notebook as well</i>
